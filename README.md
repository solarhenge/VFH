# Project: Vehicle For Hire (VFH)

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to manage VFH data that is submitted on a monthly basis via the internet. VFH are taxis, limousines and other vehicles, including those hired by way of an online application.

## Project Description
In this project, I have written a number of python programs that facilitate an ETL pipeline. The output is a series of csv files that can be used by financial resources for invoicing purposes.
